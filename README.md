# shitzerkerusearejuv

not spending any time on this, if you cant be asked to pop a rejuv when you pop unleash on zerker, here you go ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

default its set to use the rejuv pot from hh boxes, but if you have other pots and cant be asked to edit the rejuvid manually, you can do /8 setpot LINKED_ITEM
